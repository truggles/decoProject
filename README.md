# decoProject

Created to collaborate on analysis of DECO data
This repository contains scripts to analyze output files from the 'plotBlobs.py'
script in the 'deco' analysis SVN.

The main script is 'muonPlotter.py' which has a dictionary that loops over the
2 camera types, and the codes loops over the 3 different contour and area cut
selections to make histograms.  There is fitting functionality built into it
which is currently turned off.
